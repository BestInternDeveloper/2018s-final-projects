## Project Abstract
Cambricon is a novel domain-specific Instruction Set Architecture for Neural Network accelerators. It is a load-store architecture that integrates scalar, vector, matrix, logical, data transfer, and control instructions, based on a comprehensive analysis of existing NN techniques.
